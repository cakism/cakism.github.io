## An introduction

I've always liked to see myself as, what recruiters would call, a fullstack dev. As in, I know enough about front-end to get by but not to comfortably work as a primary front-end dev. Java backend is where I've enjoyed working the most, but with a recent change in the organization at my work I've been given the opportunity to transition coding for our Android app instead which is currently done in Kotlin. 

This blog is supposed to record my path to becoming an android dev and the gotcha's on the way.
